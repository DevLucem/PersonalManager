An app to manage and track your life

### The Goal
To always know what is important in your life and concentrate on
the projects that really matter to you. This is visioning your
life without all the clutter. If something is important to do,
add it as a project, add the small milestones and a few tasks to
do to achieve the milestones and with no time you will start seeing
results in your life!

Built with `vite` and `svelte` ♥

### What it can do
1. manage your project from start to end
2. setup small milestones with individual tasks
3. Reminders that are recurring and also with date and time
4. Manage what is important with tags
